# SETEC threshold calibration provenance

## Policy: this ledger is an audit trail, not a registry of authoritative thresholds

As of 2026-05-11, SETEC follows a **"Stylometry to the people"** posture: the framework ships methods, tooling, and PROVENANCE discipline. It does not ship per-signal decision thresholds derived from labeled corpora (EditLens, RAID, MAGE, or any other) as load-bearing defaults. Anchored thresholds derived from one corpus do not generalize to the user's register mix without local recalibration, and shipping them as defaults would constitute the implicit-generalization claim SETEC otherwise refuses to make.

What this means in practice:

- **Calibration runs documented in this ledger are audit records of work performed**, not assertions that the derived numbers should be used at runtime by anyone other than the original calibrator.
- **`COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` ships with `provisional=True` and `provenance=None` for every signal.** The "Status" section below stays at "0 of 11" as a load-bearing invariant under this policy.
- **Users wanting a corpus-anchored threshold for their own context** should run `calibrate_thresholds.py` against their own labeled baseline. The PROVENANCE pattern is the methodology to follow; the entries below are illustrative examples of what a calibration run produces, not a registry of authoritative numbers.
- **Entries pre-dating this policy** are tagged below with a `[POLICY: AUDIT-ONLY]` banner. The numbers stay in `thresholds_calibrated.json` for reproducibility, but `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` was reverted to its pre-calibration heuristic for the affected signals.

The policy reflects the framework's claim-license discipline. Earlier turns of SETEC development treated EditLens-derived thresholds as the validation outcome that lets a signal "graduate" from heuristic to calibrated; the implicit assumption was that EditLens-anchored numbers would generalize to other registers and corpora. Surveying RAID and MAGE made that assumption visible and untenable. The cleaner posture: ship methods + tooling + provenance discipline, let users anchor against their own corpora.

---

This ledger records every empirically-calibrated per-signal
threshold derived from SETEC's calibration toolchain, with full
provenance. Derived values are abstract aggregate measurements
(CC-NC corpora used for derivation are not redistributed).

v1 covers per-signal thresholds only; band thresholds, directional-
cluster consistency, and POS-bigram smoothing α stay heuristic. See
`internal/SPEC_calibration_toolchain.md` (gitignored) for the
toolchain design and the calibration-vs-evaluation split policy.

Format: one section per threshold, in chronological order. New
entries land via PR. Slugs match the keys in
`scripts/calibration/thresholds_calibrated.json`.

## Status

Under the "Stylometry to the people" policy stated above, **no
thresholds are encoded as load-bearing in the runtime registry**.
All 11 signal thresholds in `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` carry
`provisional=True` and `provenance=None`. Variance audits report
"0 of 11 signal thresholds carry calibration provenance" in the
Calibration status footer. This is the load-bearing invariant
under the current policy, not a transitional state.

To populate this ledger:

1. Install calibration deps: `pip install -r requirements-calibration.txt` (only required for the HuggingFace fetch path; the GitHub path below is stdlib-only).
2. Fetch the corpus. **Two paths**, equivalent CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license posture:
   - **GitHub (recommended for first-time runs).** No auth, no license-acceptance UI, no HF token. Stdlib only:
     ```
     python3 scripts/calibration/fetch_pangram_editlens_github.py \
         --split nonnative_english
     # or pin a specific upstream commit for reproducibility:
     python3 scripts/calibration/fetch_pangram_editlens_github.py \
         --split nonnative_english \
         --commit-sha <sha>
     ```
     The GitHub fetcher writes the same `NOTICE.md` license + provenance block as the HuggingFace fetcher and a `.fetch_record.json` containing the pinned commit SHA + per-file SHA-256 hashes for tamper detection.
   - **HuggingFace (license-card check, dataset-revision pin).** Requires `HF_TOKEN` and license acceptance at https://huggingface.co/datasets/pangram/editlens_iclr:
     ```
     python3 scripts/calibration/fetch_pangram_editlens.py \
         --split nonnative_english
     ```
     The HuggingFace path additionally verifies the dataset card declares CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 at fetch time. Use this path when the calibration run's provenance entry should reference an HF dataset revision rather than a GitHub commit.

   Both fetchers write to `ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/` and both produce CSVs the next step's preset shapes consume. `calibrate_thresholds.py` reads `.fetch_record.json` and writes the corpus pin into the provenance entry's `corpus` field; both fetcher records use a `revision` key (the GitHub fetcher's commit SHA aliases as `revision` for HF-compat) so the downstream calibrator doesn't care which fetcher produced the file.
3. Convert to manifest: `python3 scripts/calibration/editlens_to_manifest.py --source <fetched-csv> --preset editlens_nonnative --out ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/manifest_nonnative.jsonl --text-dir ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/nonnative_text`
4. **Survey** every signal in `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` (all 11) before picking the first to encode (see "Selection criteria" below — do not assume any specific signal is the first to land). The survey wrapper handles the loop, the aggregation, and the gate evaluation:
   ```
   python3 scripts/calibration/calibration_survey.py \
       --manifest ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/manifest_nonnative.jsonl \
       --fpr-target 0.01 \
       --use validation \
       --out ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/_survey_2026-XX-XX.json
   ```
   The wrapper runs every signal through `calibrate_thresholds.derive_threshold`, evaluates the four automatable selection-criteria gates (polarity, FPR resolution, TPR ≥ floor, calibrated-vs-heuristic aggressiveness), leaves Gate 2 (AUC/AP not embarrassing) for maintainer judgment, and prints a single ranked markdown table to stdout plus a JSON ledger to `--out`. The survey JSON is private (treat as scratch); only the first signal that earns provenance under the criteria below lands in the committed `thresholds_calibrated.json`.

   Three flags worth knowing about:

   - `--no-tier2` and `--no-tier3` skip the spaCy POS-bigram and SBERT/TF-IDF cohesion features for a faster Tier-1-only sweep. Useful as a cheap first pass while you decide which signals are worth the full compute.
   - `--signal <name>` restricts the survey to one signal. Useful for re-checking a specific calibration after the corpus or the registry changed.
   - `--max-entries N` caps the manifest entries scored per signal. Label-stratified sub-sampling, deterministic via the bootstrap seed (or `--max-entries-seed`). **Use this for pipeline checks before committing to a full calibration run.** A partial run verifies the toolchain works end-to-end (deps, SSL, spaCy model, manifest shape), surfaces any environment friction, and gives you a wall-clock estimate for the full run. Small-N runs will not pass the FPR-resolution and TPR-interpretability gates and the resulting threshold MUST NOT be committed to the ledger — the survey output marks `--max-entries` runs as `is_pipeline_check: true` and the inner `derive_threshold` tags the resulting provenance entry's `notes` with a "PIPELINE CHECK" prefix and a `sub_sample` block. Example partial-run sequence:
     ```
     # 10% pipeline check (~13 essays of the 130-essay ESL slice):
     python3 scripts/calibration/calibration_survey.py \
         --manifest ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/manifest_nonnative.jsonl \
         --fpr-target 0.01 \
         --max-entries 13 \
         --no-tier2 --no-tier3 \
         --out /tmp/_pipeline_check.json
     # If that runs cleanly, commit to the full run:
     python3 scripts/calibration/calibration_survey.py \
         --manifest ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/manifest_nonnative.jsonl \
         --fpr-target 0.01 \
         --out ai-prose-baselines-private/editlens/_survey_2026-XX-XX.json
     ```
5. Pick the signals whose calibration entries pass the **Selection criteria**.
6. **Document the run as an audit entry in this file.** Use the **Template for new entries** below, tag with `[POLICY: AUDIT-ONLY]`, and reference the synthesis doc (a sibling of `references/calibration-findings-2026-05-10.md`) where the cross-signal narrative and any polarity-inversion findings get the longer treatment. The corresponding entry in `scripts/calibration/thresholds_calibrated.json` is the calibrator's audit ledger; under the Stylometry-to-the-people policy this is the load-bearing artifact for the run.
7. **Do NOT edit `scripts/variance_audit.py`'s `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS`** to set `provenance=<slug>`, `provisional=False`, and `value=<derived>` as a framework commit. The pre-policy workflow (in place through v1.42.3) did exactly that and produced a single committed EditLens-anchored threshold that was rolled back in v1.42.6 when the MAGE calibration surfaced the cross-corpus polarity-inversion finding. The framework's shipped `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` values stay at the pre-calibration heuristic level (`provisional=True`, `provenance=None`) regardless of how many corpora the calibration toolchain has run against.
8. **Two legitimate next moves**, depending on what you want from the calibration:
   - **Audit-only PR**: ship the PROVENANCE entry + the synthesis doc + an updated CHANGELOG that names the policy-compliant audit record. `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` stays unchanged. This is the framework-side workflow for nearly all calibration runs.
   - **User-local fork (NOT a framework commit)**: in your own deployment, you may legitimately want to apply the calibrated thresholds locally for *your* register mix and corpus context. Maintain the change on a private branch or a local config override; do NOT submit it as a framework PR. The framework's posture is that anchored thresholds are user-side decisions, not framework defaults.
9. **CHANGELOG entry** describes the audit-only nature of the run, names the polarity-inversion findings where applicable, and explicitly does NOT claim the framework's shipped thresholds changed.

## Selection criteria for a calibration entry

Pre-registered before any data was inspected. A signal earns its first committed `provenance` slug only when all five gates pass. A signal that fails any gate is documented as a calibration *finding* (recorded in the survey, not in the committed ledger), not a threshold to encode.

1. **Expected polarity matches.** Empirical AUC ≥ 0.5 in the registry's declared `direction`. If the registry says a signal is `lt` (compressed when low) but the calibration sweep finds the opposite direction discriminates better, the corpus's polarity inverts the registry's. That's a *finding* about the corpus or about the registry's polarity convention, not a threshold to commit.
2. **AUC / AP not embarrassing.** No fixed cutoff baked into the toolchain — left to maintainer judgment per signal. Low-discrimination signals (AUC ~0.55-0.65) become part of the visible record via the provenance entry rather than something the threshold value alone can hide. The bar a calibrated threshold should clear is "the empirical evidence in the entry would not embarrass a careful reviewer."
3. **Enough negative controls for the requested FPR.** The toolchain's `fpr_resolution = 1 / n_neg` check enforces the lower bound. The softer question this gate adds: *even if the FPR target is reachable, is the resulting TPR statistically interpretable?* Wide bootstrap CIs on TPR at the chosen threshold mean the operating point is noisy; commit anyway only with explicit acknowledgement in the entry's `notes` field.
4. **Interpretable threshold (not "predict almost nothing").** If the highest-TPR threshold within the FPR ceiling fires the signal on 1/130 positives, the threshold is technically valid but operationally meaningless. Look for thresholds with TPR substantially above zero at the chosen FPR target.
5. **ESL slice behaves conservatively.** When calibrating against `nonnative_english.csv` (the ESL slice), the calibrated threshold is implicitly tuned to spare ESL writers from false-positive labeling. If the threshold ends up *more aggressive* than the heuristic on this corpus, that is surprising — investigate before committing. The framework's ethical commitment is that ESL prose is not the failure mode the band classifier should aggressively flag.

## Available calibration corpora

Three labeled corpora ship as fetcher pipelines under
`scripts/calibration/`. Pick the one whose license posture and
shape match the calibration run you want to commit.

| Corpus | License | Rows | Size | Fetcher | Manifest converter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EditLens** (Pangram) | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | ~14 K | ~62 MB | `fetch_pangram_editlens.py` / `fetch_pangram_editlens_github.py` | `editlens_to_manifest.py` |
| **RAID** (Dugan et al., NAACL 2024) | Apache-2.0 | ~8 M | ~16.7 GB | `fetch_raid.py` | `raid_to_manifest.py` |
| **MAGE** (Li et al., ACL 2024) | MIT | ~437 K | ~554 MB | `fetch_mage.py` | `mage_to_manifest.py` |

**License posture matters for the ledger.** EditLens-derived
thresholds carry the CC-NC awkwardness — the calibration
toolchain treats EditLens as local-only; derived single-float
thresholds ship under SETEC's GPL-3 as aggregate measurements
of pipeline behavior, not adaptations of corpus content. RAID
and MAGE are permissively licensed; derived thresholds carry an
attribution trailer in NOTICE but no redistribution constraint
on the corpora themselves.

**Coverage tradeoffs.** EditLens is small but ships with
reference-detector scores (Fast-DetectGPT, Binoculars,
EditLens-Llama, EditLens-RoBERTa, Pangram v3.2) that let the
ledger cross-reference. RAID is large and adversarial-rich (12
attack transforms × 11 models × 8 domains); the right corpus
for R7's robustness card AND for threshold calibration that
should generalize across decoding strategies. MAGE is the
cross-check: 10 source datasets, binary labels, no adversarial
variants, useful for confirming RAID-derived thresholds aren't
overfit to RAID's generation distribution.

**Recommended sequence for the first cross-corpus calibration:**

1. `python3 scripts/calibration/fetch_raid.py --subset train --no-adversarial` — pulls labeled English without adversarial (~802 MB; everything you need for first-pass calibration of the 11 `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` thresholds).
2. `python3 scripts/calibration/raid_to_manifest.py --no-adversarial --no-nonprose` — converts to manifest.
3. Run `calibration_survey.py` against the RAID manifest; commit any signals whose RAID-derived threshold passes the five selection-criteria gates.
4. `python3 scripts/calibration/fetch_mage.py` — pulls all of MAGE (~554 MB).
5. `python3 scripts/calibration/mage_to_manifest.py` — converts MAGE.
6. Run `calibration_survey.py` against the MAGE manifest. Confirm RAID-derived thresholds replicate. Where they don't, the divergence goes into the calibration *findings* (not the ledger) and becomes part of the next ledger entry's `notes`.
7. For R7's adversarial robustness card: pull the adversarial variants (`fetch_raid.py` without `--no-adversarial`, ~17 GB total) and feed `adversarial_robustness_card.py` from the RAID adversarial-class slices.

## In-sample calibration

The empirical metrics in every committed provenance entry (AUC, AP, TPR / FPR / precision at the chosen threshold, bootstrap CIs) are computed on the same corpus the threshold was derived from. They are not heldout-test performance claims.

A heldout test split is roadmap. Until then, every committed threshold's evidentiary weight is:

> "This value separates the two classes on this fixture under this calibration method."

It is not:

> "This value generalizes to other corpora, registers, or AI-prose generations."

That distinction lives in three places to keep it from drifting:

- The `notes` field of every JSON ledger entry (`thresholds_calibrated.json`).
- The **Notes** bullet in every Markdown ledger entry (this file).
- The CHANGELOG entry's prose for every calibrated-threshold commit, until a heldout split lands.

When the heldout split lands, the seatbelt phrase changes from "in-sample" to "out-of-sample" and prior entries can be re-evaluated against held-out data and either confirmed (provenance gains a `heldout_validation` block) or flagged (entry annotated with the divergence).

## Calibration commit shape

Pre-registered. Each calibration commit should be a small reviewable diff covering exactly four artifacts:

- One `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` registry edit (`value` + `provenance` + `provisional` flipped together — the `ThresholdSpec` dataclass enforces the `provisional` / `provenance` mutex in `__post_init__`).
- One new section in this file using the **Template for new entries** below.
- One element appended to `scripts/calibration/thresholds_calibrated.json` (the calibrator does this automatically; review the diff).
- CHANGELOG entry + `plugin.json` version bump. PATCH if the calibration is documentation-shaped (no behavior change because the new value lands close to the old heuristic); MINOR if the band classifier's verdict will shift on borderline documents under realistic inputs.

The 9 corpus-independent regression tests in `scripts/tests/test_calibration_provenance.py` will catch any drift across the four artifacts before the commit can land. The 10th test (corpus-dependent re-derive) will additionally re-run calibration in environments where the private corpus is available.

## Calibrated thresholds

## editlens_val_burstiness_B_fpr0.01_2026-05-10

> **[POLICY: AUDIT-ONLY]** This entry pre-dates the "Stylometry to the people" policy stated at the top of this file. The derived value (`-0.6227...`) is preserved here and in `thresholds_calibrated.json` for reproducibility, but `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS["burstiness_B"]` was reverted on 2026-05-11 to its pre-calibration heuristic (`-0.40`, `provisional=True`, `provenance=None`). The framework does not assert that this EditLens-anchored value generalizes to other registers or corpora; users wanting an anchored threshold against their own baseline should run `calibrate_thresholds.py` locally.

- **Signal:** `burstiness_B` (direction `lt`)
- **Derived value:** `-0.622724270454707`
- **Corpus:** EditLens val split (`pangramlabs/EditLens` GitHub mirror, commit `05a588f15d792330ccaf91be8ee4fdb54ce26835`)
- **License:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (local-only use; not redistributed)
- **Calibration:** direction-aware FPR-target sweep at FPR ≤ `0.01`
- **Split role:** calibration_only (in-sample; heldout test split is roadmap)
- **FPR resolution:** `1/n_neg = 0.001328` (`753` negatives)
- **Empirical:** AUC `0.317` (raw) / `0.683` (direction-aware), AP `0.388`, TPR `0.0704` `[0.0524, 0.0889]` at FPR `0.0093` `[0.0028, 0.0167]`, precision `0.883` `[0.794, 0.958]`
- **CI method:** fixed-threshold paired bootstrap (`2000` resamples, seed `42`)
- **SETEC commit:** `dee8f6f858ffe0786d84767bd3f96cf83d3aa2e5`
- **Date:** 2026-05-10
- **Notes:** First committed calibration against the SETEC framework. Polarity matches the registry's smoothing-diagnosis hypothesis (AI prose has lower sentence-length variance than human prose) on this corpus — direction-aware AUC 0.683 confirms a moderate-strength real signal. The calibrated threshold is more *conservative* than the prior heuristic (-0.622 < -0.40 means a stricter "below threshold" condition), catching 7.0% of AI essays at the cost of 0.93% false positives on human writers, with a precision of 88% at the operating point. The corpus is the EditLens val split — predominantly student-essay register, with the human comparator being ESL student writing. Generalization to the canonical SETEC registers (literary fiction, blog essay, academic philosophy) is **unverified**; out-of-corpus performance is the heldout-split roadmap deliverable. Five other registry signals showed direction-aware AUC ≥ 0.5 on this corpus (`sentence_length_sd`, `adjacent_cosine_sd`, `fkgl_sd`, `mdd_sd`, `connective_density`) but failed gate 4 (TPR floor at FPR ≤ 0.01); five signals (`mtld`, `mattr`, `shannon_entropy`, `yules_k`, `adjacent_cosine_mean`) had inverted polarity on this corpus — see `references/calibration-findings-2026-05-10.md` for the polarity-inversion analysis. The bootstrap CI here is fixed-threshold paired (it bounds rate uncertainty at the chosen threshold, not selection uncertainty in the threshold itself); selection uncertainty via nested bootstrap is roadmap.

## mage_full_tier1_fpr0.01_2026-05-11

> **[POLICY: AUDIT-ONLY]** Audit record under the "Stylometry to the people" policy stated at the top of this file. No threshold from this run is encoded in `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS`. The empirical findings are recorded here for reproducibility and for the cross-corpus comparison documented in `references/calibration-findings-2026-05-11-mage.md`.

- **Run type:** Full Tier-1 survey across all 11 SETEC signals (8 Tier 1 scored; Tier 2 / Tier 3 skipped via `--no-tier2 --no-tier3`)

- **License (precise):**
  - **Paper**: MIT (per Li et al. 2024)
  - **HuggingFace dataset card**: Apache-2.0 (observed 2026-05-10; `fetch_mage.py` accepts MIT or Apache-2.0 at fetch time and records the observed value in the corpus NOTICE.md)
  - **Source-dataset texts**: 10 underlying datasets with per-source licenses; aggregate wrapper does not override per-source restrictions
  - **SETEC framework code** (fetcher, manifest converter, calibration toolchain): GPL-3-or-later
  - **Posture**: local-only per Stylometry-to-the-people; MAGE-derived corpus content is not redistributed in framework artifacts
- **Manifest path:** `ai-prose-baselines-private/mage/manifest.jsonl` (436,606 rows total)
- **Calibration:** direction-aware FPR-target sweep at FPR ≤ `0.01`

- **n_pos / n_neg:** 120,476 AI / 217,750 human (338,226 rows after `use: validation` filter)
- **FPR resolution:** `1/n_neg = 4.59e-06` (217,750 negatives — far more than needed for the 0.01 FPR target)
- **Wall-clock:** ~15h 8m single-threaded on M-series Mac (inside the predicted 11-18h window from the README costs table)
- **CI method:** fixed-threshold paired bootstrap (2000 resamples, seed 42)
- **SETEC commit:** main at 1.42.5 + open PRs #15/16/17 (the survey was launched from 1.42.5 state before subsequent work landed)

### Per-signal results

| signal | registry direction | raw AUC | da_AUC | TPR at threshold | polarity | gates passed |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|
| `mattr` | lt | 0.425 | **0.575** | 0.0025% | matches | 3 of 4 |
| `mtld` | lt | 0.436 | **0.564** | 0.020% | matches | 3 of 4 |
| `yules_k` | gt | 0.560 | **0.560** | 0.014% | matches | 3 of 4 |
| `shannon_entropy` | lt | 0.483 | **0.517** | 0.016% | matches (weak) | 3 of 4 |
| `connective_density` | gt | 0.493 | 0.493 | 0.60% | **inverted** | 2 of 4 |
| `sentence_length_sd` | lt | 0.521 | 0.479 | — | **inverted** | 2 of 4 |
| `fkgl_sd` | lt | 0.521 | 0.479 | — | **inverted** | 2 of 4 |
| `burstiness_B` | lt | 0.546 | 0.454 | 0.58% | **inverted** | 2 of 4 |
| `adjacent_cosine_mean` | (tier 3) | — | — | — | not scored | 0 of 0 |
| `adjacent_cosine_sd` | (tier 3) | — | — | — | not scored | 0 of 0 |
| `mdd_sd` | (tier 2) | — | — | — | not scored | 0 of 0 |

The four-of-four passable gates are `polarity_matches`, `enough_negatives`, `interpretable_threshold` (TPR floor), and `esl_conservative`. The fifth gate (`auc_ap_not_embarrassing`) is left to maintainer judgment per the calibration toolchain's selection criteria; `null` for every row above. The `interpretable_threshold` gate failed for every signal because the TPR at the 1% FPR operating point sits well below the 5% floor — the framework's stated minimum for a "non-trivial fraction of AI essays caught."

### Headline finding

**0 of 11 signals passed all gates.** No signal earns a committed threshold under the framework's pre-registered selection criteria. Even if the framework's policy permitted shipping anchored thresholds (which it does not, per the "Stylometry to the people" posture), the MAGE results would not produce one.

### Cross-corpus polarity inversion

Every Tier 1 signal that produced a comparable measurement on both EditLens (2026-05-10) and MAGE (2026-05-11) **flipped polarity between the two corpora**. The signals that matched the registry hypothesis on EditLens (`burstiness_B`, `sentence_length_sd`, `fkgl_sd`, `connective_density`) inverted on MAGE. The signals that inverted on EditLens (`mattr`, `mtld`, `yules_k`, `shannon_entropy`) matched polarity on MAGE. This is the load-bearing finding: stylometric signals do not have stable polarity across corpora because the polarity depends on what the human comparator looks like. EditLens's ESL-student-writing comparator and MAGE's adversarial-mixed comparator produce opposite-direction signals for the same underlying corpus property.

### Implication for the framework

The MAGE result confirms the "Stylometry to the people" policy as load-bearing. No single corpus produces a threshold that generalizes to another; the framework's value is the methodology and the per-user calibration discipline, not the shipped numbers. Future RAID calibration runs will produce a third polarity profile; the prediction matches the cross-corpus evidence we have.

## Template for new entries

When you populate a calibration run, format the entry like this:

```markdown
## <slug>

- **Signal:** `<heuristic_key>` (direction `<gt|lt>`)
- **Derived value:** `<float>`
- **Corpus:** `<corpus_name>` (HF revision `<sha>`)
- **License:** `<license>` (local-only use; not redistributed)
- **Calibration:** direction-aware FPR-target sweep at FPR ≤ `<target>`
- **Split role:** calibration_only (in-sample; heldout test split is roadmap)
- **FPR resolution:** `1/n_neg = <value>` (`<n_neg>` negatives)
- **Empirical:** AUC `<auc>`, AP `<ap>`, TPR `<tpr>` `[<lo>, <hi>]` at FPR `<fpr>`
- **CI method:** fixed-threshold paired bootstrap (`<resamples>` resamples, seed `<seed>`)
- **SETEC commit:** `<sha>`
- **Date:** `<iso>`
- **Notes:** `<context>`
```

Slugs follow the convention `<corpus>_<signal>_fpr<target>_<iso-date>`,
e.g. `editlens_nonnative_burstiness_B_fpr0.01_2026-05-08`. The
slug is the foreign key into
`scripts/calibration/thresholds_calibrated.json`; matching slugs
across the registry, the JSON ledger, and this Markdown ledger are
what `scripts/tests/test_calibration_provenance.py` enforces.

## Reading this ledger

- Every entry references the corpus by name + URL + revision SHA;
  no entry quotes corpus content or per-row reference-detector
  scores.
- The `derived_value` is the floating-point threshold encoded in
  `scripts/variance_audit.py`'s `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` registry.
- The empirical metrics (AUC, AP, TPR, FPR, precision, CIs) are
  in-sample on the corpus the threshold was derived from. Heldout
  performance is roadmap.
- The CI is fixed-threshold paired bootstrap on rate uncertainty;
  it does not capture the uncertainty in selecting the threshold
  itself (selection uncertainty is a nested bootstrap, roadmap).
- A threshold without a section here means it's still heuristic /
  provisional. Audit the variance audit JSON's `calibration_status`
  block to see which signals are which.

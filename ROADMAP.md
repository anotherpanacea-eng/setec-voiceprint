# setec-voiceprint: Roadmap

The architectural narrative and the path from MVP to validated framework. Internal working notes (session logs, design discussions, private corpus references) live separately.

## Current state

The framework ships a three-layer architecture (Layer A distributional diagnostics, Layer B AIC pattern flags, Layer C source triage), four task surfaces (smoothing diagnosis, voice coherence, validation, craft restoration), eleven Python scripts spanning the smoothing-diagnosis and voice-coherence surfaces, four reference documents, and the first piece of the validation surface (`manifest_validator.py`).

What is shipped:

- **Layer A scripts.** `variance_audit.py` (single-document distributional diagnostic with sliding-window mode), `manuscript_audit.py` (cross-chapter aggregate), `repetition_audit.py` (vocabulary over-representation), `manuscript_repetition_audit.py` (manuscript-aggregate habit vocabulary), `chapter_distinctiveness_audit.py` (leave-one-out internal-baseline distinctiveness).
- **Voice-coherence scripts.** `voice_distance.py` (target-vs-baseline distance with feature-cluster mode), `voice_profile.py` (private voiceprint), `stylometry_core.py` (shared feature extraction).
- **Validation scripts.** `manifest_validator.py` (schema and integrity checks for `corpus_manifest.jsonl`).
- **References.** Layer A math (`distributional-diagnostics.md`), Layer B flag families with genre tolerance table (`aic-flags.md`), Layer C source triage (`source-triage.md`), figure-by-flag countermoves (`rhetorical-countermoves.md`), and implementation/dependency survey notes (`implementation-survey.md`).

Every script's JSON output carries a `task_surface` tag so downstream consumers can route by surface. The framework refuses the unifying "is this AI" verdict; the math does not entitle it.

## Architecture: MVP to cathedral

The framework currently sits at MVP: it answers "how far is this draft from this baseline?" given a baseline corpus and a target document. Cathedral status would answer the grown-up version: given the right comparison set, length, register, time period, and known failure modes, what can be responsibly inferred, how confident, where in the text the signal lives, and what the practical revision decision is.

The epistemic shift is the load-bearing claim. Cathedral status does not mean "the tool can prove AI." It means every output knows what comparison it is making, what it cannot know, and what practical revision decision follows. Numbers are subordinate to the claim; the claim is subordinate to the comparison; the comparison is subordinate to the manifest.

### Eight cathedral upgrades

The substantive design moves the roadmap is organized around:

1. **Manifest as law, not convenience.** Every tool reads from `corpus_manifest.jsonl`; no serious run uses loose directories. The manifest gets validation: missing files, bad labels, AI-contaminated baseline entries, register mismatches, privacy violations. Status: `manifest_validator.py` shipped; wiring into manifest-consuming scripts is the next step.

2. **Length-matched bootstrap.** Instead of comparing a 300-word target to 8,000-word baseline files, sample hundreds of 300-word windows from the baseline and report where the target falls. Empirical percentiles replace noisy z-scores. Status: scoped, not yet built. Pairs with the sliding-window mode shipped in `variance_audit.py`.

3. **Validation harness.** Labeled test set with known-human, known-AI, AI-edited, mixed, paraphrased, and human-revised-after-AI samples. Per-register thresholds with FPR/FNR/ROC/PR and confidence intervals. Status: scoped, not yet built. Depends on the manifest validator (shipped) and the bootstrap (above).

4. **Impostor baselines.** Compare the target writer against plausible other writers in matched registers. Without these, the voiceprint over-attributes register and topic to identity. Status: scoped; corpus collection is largely a manual and ethical-permissions task.

5. **Sliding-window localization.** Whole-chapter distance is blunt. Cathedral version says "the drift is concentrated in paragraphs 12-19, mostly function words and sentence cohesion" with a heatmap. Status: sliding-window mode shipped in `variance_audit.py` with band classification per window; heatmap visualization is roadmap.

6. **Voice profile expansion.** Add idiolectic phrase extraction, collocations, sentence-shape distributions, readability spread, MTLD/MATTR/Yule ranges, time drift, POV-specific profiles, and a "do not normalize these phrases" preservation list. Status: core profile shipped in `voice_profile.py` with function-word, character-n-gram, punctuation cadence, paragraph/dialogue, and pronoun-modal-negation features. Idiolect extraction and time-drift tracking are roadmap.

7. **Before/after restoration loop.** Run a draft, revise, rerun, and compare whether the changes restored voice or just gamed the metrics. Without this loop, the tool eventually teaches metric-chasing. Status: scoped, not yet built.

8. **Privacy and packaging guards.** The system refuses to export private baselines or voice profiles into publishable plugin folders. Status: `voice_profile.py` refuses output paths outside `ai-prose-baselines-private/` unless `--allow-public-output` is passed; `manifest_validator.py` enforces a privacy ratchet on `voice_profile`-tagged entries.

### Phase 1 to Phase 2 operational sequence

The structural backbone for the validation spine. Steps 1 and 2 are shipped; steps 3, 4, and 5 are next.

1. **`manifest_validator.py`.** Schema and integrity checks on `corpus_manifest.jsonl`. Refuses runs that depend on a contaminated or contradictory manifest. Status: **shipped.**
2. **`task_surface` field in every script's JSON output.** Surface separation enforceable in code rather than vigilable by humans. Status: **shipped.**
3. **Length-matched bootstrap** for `voice_distance.py` and `variance_audit.py`. Replaces noisy z-scores at small N with empirical percentiles drawn from length-matched windows of the baseline corpus. Status: scoped.
4. **`validation_harness.py`.** Reads the validated manifest, runs labeled samples through the surface-tagged scripts, reports performance by task surface × register × length × AI status. Status: scoped.
5. **Report template: "what this result licenses / does not license."** Every harness output carries an explicit licensing block: inputs, comparison set, length range, register match, confidence interval, and the specific claim the result does and does not entitle. Status: scoped.

### Borrow-before-building track

The validation and idiolect roadmap should start from known implementations before local code gets written. `references/implementation-survey.md` records the current survey:

- Use `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels` for validation metrics and confidence intervals.
- Use SciPy's bootstrap machinery under SETEC's own length-matched window sampler.
- Treat R `stylo` as the Delta / cosine / rolling-Delta / General-Imposters oracle before expanding voice-distance verification.
- Treat `quanteda::textstat_keyness` and NLTK collocations as the design references for idiolect and preservation-list extraction.
- Keep privacy guards, report claim language, task-surface routing, and craft triage local.

## Open architectural questions

### Layer A

- Should `COMPRESSION_HEURISTICS` thresholds and weights be configurable? Currently constants in `variance_audit.py`. Configurable would let users tune for their register without editing source.
- Per-character variance signals in multi-POV fiction. MATTR within one POV character's passages may differ from another's. The current variance audit doesn't slice by POV. Worth considering once the per-POV diagnostic matters.
- Scene-shape-aware diagnostics. The lexical-compression signal does different work in different chapters (closed-room scenes have small vocabulary scope; revision smoothing tightens vocabulary). Distinguishing the two is hard to operationalize.

### Layer B

- AIC-7 named subtypes vs. evidence categories. Currently subtypes nest under evidence categories. Promoting subtypes to top-level may read more cleanly.
- Cross-cutting flag relationships. Lexical genericism touches both AIC-2 and AIC-7. Real audit experience will surface which boundary placements are useful.

### Layer C

- Voice attribution for narrators with multiple registers. The current voice test is binary; a multi-register version would ask "which of this character's registers should this be in?"
- The "earned by frame" verdict. Some passages are earned because the surrounding prose explicitly diagnoses them. A third verdict beyond earned and unearned is worth naming.

### Cross-layer

- Calibration of the directional-cluster threshold (0.7) against a labeled corpus. Currently a heuristic with documented step effects (3-feature clusters require 3/3, 4-feature 3/4, 5-feature 4/5).
- Calibration of the band-classification fraction thresholds (0.15, 0.40) against a labeled corpus. Currently fractions of available signal weight, not absolute percentages of evidence.
- POS-bigram KL/JSD smoothing constant. Currently add-one Laplace smoothing on the union of bigrams; literature suggests add-α with α<1 may be more principled. Calibration against a labeled corpus is the right time to tighten this.

## Voice fingerprint risk surface

The diagnostic outputs are voice-cloning inputs. The signals the variance and repetition audits compute (function-word distribution, sentence-length distribution, POS-bigram frequencies, idiolectic phrases) are exactly the inputs a stylometric voice-cloning system would consume. Three paths a hostile actor could take with a leaked voice profile: prompt-conditioning an LLM with the stylometric constraints; fine-tuning an LLM on the corpus directly; using the profile as a reward signal during generation. The framework's tools do not enable any of these directly, but a documented fingerprint makes any of them easier.

The framework's privacy posture is therefore protective by default. Personal baselines and voice profiles live in a separate private directory rather than this repo. `voice_profile.py` refuses publishable output paths unless explicitly overridden. The manifest validator enforces a privacy ratchet on voiceprint-tagged sources. The skill itself is publishable; the corpus and the voice profile that derives from it are not. Maintainers and contributors should respect this boundary.

## Design notes worth keeping

**The framework targets discourse habits, not vocabulary.** Surface tells (specific AI words, em-dash frequency) decay as models change. The named patterns are syntactic; they survive vocabulary shifts.

**Three layers stay distinct.** Layer A is mathematical, Layer B is craft-pattern recognition, Layer C is voice attribution. The framework's value depends on not collapsing them.

**Source triage is the hardest part to teach and the most valuable.** Most surface flags resolve as earned on triage. The framework's authority comes from being honest about that.

**Genre tolerance varies meaningfully.** A pattern that signals trouble in literary fiction may be partially structural to testimony or blog. The genre tolerance table consolidates the calibration notes.

**The personal baseline is the operative diagnostic.** Heuristic thresholds catch unsubtle cases. Always run with a register-matched personal baseline if available.

**The em-dash question is style preference, not AI signal.** A separate lens handles the specific surface tells. This framework catches the patterns underneath.
